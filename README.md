# EdRegistry

EdRegistry is a **website explorer for EdFile data from LEGO TTGames**.  
It allows you to **view, search, sort, and filter** a CSV containing information extracted from EdFiles of LEGO TTGames games using a custom parser.

The site is fully **static**, hosted on **GitHub Pages**, and features:

- Interactive table with **sorting, pagination, and column filters**
- **Instant search**
- Modern **Dark / Light mode**, responsive

## 📂 Data Source

The CSV file `data/EdRegistry.csv` is based on the work of **[JayFranco](https://github.com/JayFrancoe)**, who generated this data from the EdFile game files of LEGO TTGames.

Thanks to him for making this project possible! 🙏

## ⚡ How it works

1. The CSV file `data/EdRegistry.csv` is versioned in the repository.
2. A **GitHub Actions workflow** automatically converts the CSV to JSON (`data/data.json`) on each commit.
3. GitHub Pages loads this JSON and dynamically generates the website.
